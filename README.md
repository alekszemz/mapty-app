<p>Discover the ultimate workout tracking tool with Mapty - a unique application that utilizes a huge map to log your exercise routes.</p>
<p>When you first load the application, your browser will ask for permission to access your location. If granted, <strong>JavaScript will automatically fetch and load the map on your current position.</strong></p>
<p>The goal of Mapty is to easily log your workouts. Simply <strong>click on the location on the map where you had a workout</strong>, and a special form with several fields will appear on the left side. Choose from options like running or cycling, fill in the distance and time, and press enter. The form will be replaced with a workout list, and you can even press on past workouts to move the map to that location.</p>
<p>Mapty was created by <strong>learning JavaScript from Jonas Schmedtmann's "The Complete JavaScript Course 2021 From Zero to Expert!" on Udemy</strong>. Try it out for yourself at <strong>https://alekszemz.github.io/mapty-app/</strong> and see how easy it is to track your workouts on a map.</p>
